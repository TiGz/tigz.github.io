                <h4>Velo Payments</h4>
                <h5>Lead API Engineer (Jan 2018 to Present)</h5>
                <p>
                    Velo Payments is a an "all remote, no offices" start-up that was re-imagining 
                    business payments for the gig-economy. Working remotely with a great team of people to engineer a truly next-gen, data-driven, 
                    cloud-agnostic payments platform with bank-grade security. During my time with Velo, I have been responsible for, among other 
                    things, designing new platform features, integrating a bunch of new payment rails, increasing the throughput of the platform 
                    by a factor of 10+ and completely re-designing the security architecture in such a way that the platform can be deployed in 
                    many different scenarios including inside a bank's own network. The last year or so have been spent re-imagining a new 
                    high-performance modulithic architecture for a new set of products and building out the infrastructure components to support that.

                <h5>Lead API Engineer (Feb 2017 to Jan 2018)</h5>
                <p>
                    AI Music was evolving music from a static, one-directional interaction to one of dynamic co-creation. I led the architecture and engineering efforts to build out Google Cloud infrastructure to support a highly ambitious mobile app as a first step on that journey. This involves a Spring Boot based API, a large social graph, many innovative audio processing components and Tensor Flow models running in Google Machine Learning Engine.

                <p>
                    Cloudburst Strategy is a consultancy that specialises in leveraging the latest emerging cloud technologies in order to deliver value to our clients. We can work with the business to build proof of concepts or MVPs quickly and cost-effictively focusing on testing hypotheses and rapid iteration. In 2016 we have been helping one organisation in the leisure travel industry to utilise Google's new Flexible App Engine in order to build out an exciting new product as a set of Spring Boot microservices.

                <p>
                    I came on board to help Steve grow the engineering team and the company. We had a good year with some tough challenges and in the process I had to get to grips with Google App Engine as well as some serious Android and iOS development. In the end some personal differences meant that we needed to part ways but the journey was a lot of fun.

                <p>
                    Fourthmate (now pinpointworks) was a side project for about 2 years where we built out an android client and a spring, couchdb and elastic search back end that was capable of visually tracking work lists for super yachts and schools. In the end the major problem was one of selling rather than technology.

                    Working as part of the Oracle Business Intelligence Infrastructure Team in Bristol on the BI Platform, Fusion Applications and later Oracle Public Cloud.

                <p>
                    I joined Comtec on the back of promises made by the company to inject resources into the Travel Gateway division so that we could re-engineer this core component of the Comtec Travel stack. I spent the first few months designing a modular and highly scalable flight booking engine using Test Driven Design, Spring 3, Spring Web Services and Maven. However, budgetary pressures meant that I found myself in more of a technical project management role.

                <p>
                    Funding difficulties meant that this promising start-up failed to survive. However, I spent my first 5 months with the company designing and prototyping a JEE standards based (EJB3, JPA, JAXB Web Services on JBoss), highly scalable, payment settlement system that was going to operate within the Amazon Web Services cloud (EC2, SQS, S3) that would have been capable of handling at least 300 million transactions per year. The RIA administration console has also been prototyped using Microsoft Silverlight and talking to the back end using SOAP Web Services.

                    Leading the development team in building an industry leading XML web service on an open source Java software stack. My job evolved along with the company and my main duties included systems architecture (new developments), software engineering (new systems and enhancements to the current systems), liaising with the other department heads (prioritising developments and open issues) and managing the work load of the development team. Although I am a capable department head, my interests clearly lie in the fields of Software Architecture and Engineering rather than managing people, which is really why I went looking for something else.
